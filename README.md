# Guess My Number

A number guessing game created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Various DOM manipulation methods and Event listeners have been used to build this project. In this game, we guess a number between 1-20 and keep guessing until we get the number correct. For every wrong guess, score is deducted and we lose if we hit score 0. Highscore functionality has also been implemented here.
